# Shapes Language

## Source

This language definition is part of the [JetBrains MPS fast track tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/fast-track-to-mps.html). This is actually the 7th step of the fast track. 
The tutorial [Shapes tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/shapes-an-introductory-mps-tutorial.html) aimes to show how to create a language. The tutorial is also posted as a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1QzHx83M4).


## My contribution
I aimed to enhance the language, as follows:
 - By adding more shapes to the language
 - Be able to use both generators (XML and Java)
